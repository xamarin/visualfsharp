## Visual Studio 15.9

You can find all tracked VS 15.9 items in the [15.9 milestone](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/milestone/24).

### F# Compiler

* Fix (#4637) - Can't debug FCS when compiled with portable pdb debug symbols, by [Jason Imison](https://github.com/nosami).
* Fix (#5355) - We fixed a bug where extension methods that take `byref` values could mutate an immutable value.
* Fix (#5446) - We improved the compile error information for overloads on `byref`/`inref`/`outref`, rather than displaying the previously obscure error.
* Fix (#5354) - Optional Type Extensions on `byref`s are now disallowed entirely. They could be declared previously, but were unusable, resulting in a confusing user experience.
* Fix (#5294) - We fixed a bug where `CompareTo` on a struct tuple and causing a type equivalence with an aliased struct tuple would result in a runtime exception.
* Fix (#5621) - We fixed a bug where use of `System.Void` in the context of authoring a Type Provider for .NET Standard could fail to find the `System.Void` type at design-time.
* Fix (#5468) - We fixed a bug where an internal error could occur when a partially applied Discriminated Union constructor is mismatched with an annotated or inferred type for the Discriminated Union.
* Fix (#5540) - We modified the compiler error message when attempting to take an address of an expression (such as accessing a property) to make it more clear that it violates scoping rules for `byref` types.
* Fix (#5536) - We fixed a bug where your program could crash at runtime when partially applying a `byref` type to a method or function. An error message will now display.
* Fix (#5459) - We fixed an issue where an invalid combination of a `byref` and a reference type (such as `byref<int> option`) would fail at runtime and not emit an error message. We now emit an error message.

### F# Tools for Visual Studio

* Fix (#5657) - We resolved an issue where metadata for F# assemblies built with the .NET Core SDK was not shown in file properties on Windows. You can now see this metadata by right-clicking an assembly on Windows and selecting **Properties**.
* Fix (#5615) - We fixed a bug where use of `module global` in F# source could cause Visual Studio to become unresponsive.
* Fix (#5515) - We fixed a bug where extension methods using `inref<'T>` would not show in completion lists.
* Fix (#5514) - We fixed a bug where the TargetFramework dropdown in Project Properties for .NET Framework F# projects was empty.
* Fix (#5507) - We fixed a bug where File | New Project on a .NET Framework 4.0 project would fail.

### F# OSS Build

* Feature (#5027) - Set VisualFSharpFull as the default startup project, by [Robert Jeppesen](https://github.com/rojepp).

## Visual Studio 15.8.5

* Fix (#5504) - Internal MSBuild Error when building non-.NET SDK projects with MSBuild parallelism
* Fix (#5518) - Visual Studio-deployed components are not NGEN'd
* Fix ([Devcom 322883](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/322883/all-net-framework-f-projects-build-to-4500-regardl.html)) - FSharp.Core 4.5.0.0 binary is deployed to FSharp.Core 4.4.3.0 location

All other closed issues for the VS 15.8 release can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/milestone/14).

## F# 4.5

We introduced the F# language version 4.5 with this release. This also corresponds with the new 4.5.x family of FSharp.Core (the F# core library). You can read the specs for each of these changes in the [F# RFC repository](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design). There are also many improvements to F# tools for Visual Studio with this release.

### Releases

* Visual Studio 2017 update 15.8
* .NET Core SDK version 2.1.400 or higher

### Language features

* Support for `voidptr`
* `NativePtr.ofVoidPtr` and `NativePtr.toVoidPtr` support
* New types: `inref<'T>`, `outref<'T>` to represent read-only and write-only `byref`s
* Support for `IsByRefLike` structs
* Support for `IsReadOnly` structs
* Full support for production and consumption of `byref` returns
* Support for extension methods for `byref`/`inref`/`outref`
* Support for `match!` in computation expressions
* Relaxed upcast requirements for `yield` in sequence, list, and array expressions
* Relaxed indentation requirements for list and array expressions
* Enumeration cases emitted as public
* Various bug fixes with `byref` programming

### FSharp.Core features

* Version aligned to 4.5.x for the NuGet package and 4.5.0.0 for the binary
* Improved strack traces for `async { }` so that user code can now be seen
* Support for `ValueOption<'T>`
* Support for `TryGetValue` on Map

### Compiler improvements

Improvements to the F# compiler in addition to the previously-mentioned language features are in F# 4.5. These include:

* Restored ability to inherit from `FSharpFunc`
* Removed ~2.2% of all allocations in the F# compiler
* F# reference normalization support for user control of transitive assembly references written to an output file
* Respecting `WarningsNotAsErrors`
* Error message improvement when branches of a pattern match do not return the same type
* Respecting `#nowarn "2003"`
* Other smaller performance improvements and many bug fixes

### Tooling improvements

Significant improvements in the F# tools, such as performance enhancements and some new editor features are included this release. As always, with a large number of contributions from the F# open source community. Here are the highlights:

* We improved IntelliSense performance for .NET SDK-style projects of all forms, including those that use multi-targeting.
* A community-driven effort to analyze and improve IntelliSense performance for very large files was contributed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko),[ Steffen Forkmann](https://github.com/forki), and [Gauthier Segay](https://github.com/smoothdeveloper). IntelliSense in very large files (10k+ lines of code) is roughly twice as fast now.
* The warning for an outdated FSharp.Core (despite the package being installed) is no longer present in .NET SDK-style projects.
* The description tooltip that displays XML documentation for a member after . in IntelliSense no longer times out after 10 seconds.
* A bug where you could not set breakpoints in object constructor arguments has been fixed.
* A bug where a renamed symbol would be duplicated when it is a generic parameter has been fixed.
* Templates for .NET Framework (classic F# templates) now consume FSharp.Core from a NuGet package, to align with .NET SDK F# templates.
* Automatic, transactional brace completion is now available for `()`, `[]`, `{}`, `[||]`, and `[<>]` brace pairs. We did this work in collaboration with [Gibran Rosa](https://github.com/gibranrosa).
* You can now go to definition with **Ctrl + Click** on an F# symbol. The settings for this gesture are also respected in the **Tools > Options** window.
* The IntelliSense performance UI has been modified to allow configuration of stale typecheck information for various IDE features. Explanations for each option are now present in tooltips for the settings.
* Brace match highlighting now correctly highlights braces, completed in collaboration with [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* Go to definition now navigates correctly when a type is defined recursively, contributed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* A bug where an auto-imported namespace wasn't opened when the top of a file was empty has been fixed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* A bug where `printf` specifiers that contained dots were miscolored has been fixed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* A bug where all opens were considered unused inside of a recursive module has been fixed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* Autocompletion for attributes now only suggests options that are actually attributes, contributed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* Signature Help tooltips are now generated for Type Provider static parameters at the constructor call site, contributed by[Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* A bug where value types used as units of measure were colored as reference types has been fixed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* A bug where semantic colorization could disappear for some files while scrolling has been fixed by  [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
There is now an experimental CodeLens implementation, contributed by [Victor Peter Rouven MÃ¼ller](https://github.com/realvictorprm). You can turn it on in **Options > Text Editor > F# > Code Lens**.
* A bug where the F# compiler service would incorrectly elide the module names in XML documentation has been fixed by [Sebastian Urban](https://github.com/surban).
* Code that uses `Dictionary` with `ContainsKey` and subsequent `Item` calls has been changed to use `TryGetValue`, by [Eugene Auduchinok](https://github.com/auduchinok).
* [Jakob Majoka](https://github.com/majocha) also contributed in the process of consuming a different API for Tooltips.

### Infrastructure, Packaging, and Open Source Improvements

We made the following enhancements to infrastructure, packaging, and our open source contribution experience:

* The F# compiler distributed with Visual Studio no longer installs as a singleton in the F# Compiler SDK location. It is now fully side-by-side with Visual Studio, meaning that side-by-side installations of Visual Studio wil finally have truly side-by-side F# tooling and language experiences.
* The FSharp.Core NuGet package is now signed.
* ETW logging has been added to the F# tools and compiler.
* The very large `control.fs`/`control.fsi` files in FSharp.Core have been split into `async.fs`/`async.fsi`, `event.fs`/`event.fsi`, `eventmodule.fs`/`eventmodule.fsi`, `mailbox.fs`/`mailbox.fsi`, and `observable.fs`/`observable.fsi`.
* We added .NET SDK-style versions of our project performance stress test artifacts.
* We removed Newtonsoft.json from our codebase, and you now have one less package downloaded for OSS contributors.
* We now use the latest versions of System.Collections.Immutable and System.Reflection.Metadata.
